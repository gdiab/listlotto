### Prompt 1

New feature: after clicking on randomize and having listlotto choose a selection, there is an option to "Pick Again". that takes me back to the "Choose for Me" state which makes the process add another step when I would prefer it just automatically chooses for me again. 

create a new branch and let's get to work. If there is any ambiguity, please ask questions.
