# CI/CD Pipeline - Currently Disabled
#
# This workflow is commented out because it would currently fail due to:
# - ESLint errors that need fixing (2 `any` types, 1 React Fast Refresh warning)
# - No test suite implemented yet
# 
# TODO: Enable this workflow after completing prerequisites in docs/TODO.md:
# 1. Fix ESLint warnings
# 2. Set up Jest and React Testing Library  
# 3. Write initial test suite
#
# Once ready, uncomment and customize this workflow for comprehensive CI/CD
